{"name":"Django-defectdojo","tagline":"DefectDojo is an open source defect tracker","body":"# Description\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of DefectDojo](https://github.com/rackerlabs/django-DefectDojo/raw/master/doc/img/screenshot1.png)\r\n\r\nDefectDojo is a tool created by the Security Engineering team at Rackspace to\r\ntrack testing efforts. It attempts to streamline the testing process by\r\noffering features such as templating, report generation, metrics, and baseline\r\nself-service tools. Though it was designed with security folks in mind, there\r\nis nothing keeping QA/QE testers, or any other testers for that matter, from\r\nusing it productively.\r\n\r\n# Demo\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to check out a demo of DefectDojo before installing it, you can\r\ncheck out our [PythonAnywhere demo site](http://defectdojo.pythonanywhere.com/).\r\n\r\nYou can log in as an administrator like so:\r\n\r\n![Admin](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6b904fa80790ed658c3b68ac4b2ad952c9f0587a/68747470733a2f2f696e76656e74726f70792e75732f64642f61646d696e2e706e67)\r\n\r\nYou can also log in as a product owner / non-staff user:\r\n\r\n![Product owner](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a5fa72d8df2699e9829d8d8d7c759b242761c6ad/68747470733a2f2f696e76656e74726f70792e75732f64642f6f776e65722e706e67)\r\n\r\n# Additional Documentation\r\n\r\nFor additional documentation you can visit our [Read the Docs site](http://defectdojo.readthedocs.org/).\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\n### [Debian or RHEL-based Install Script](./doc/install_bash.md)\r\nJay has also created a detailed guide for setting up DefectDojo on \r\n[Ubuntu 14.04](https://github.com/rackerlabs/django-DefectDojo/wiki/DefectDojo-Installation-Guide---Ubuntu-Desktop-14.04).\r\n\r\n### [Vagrant](./doc/install_vagrant.md)\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\n\r\nWe recommend checking out the [about](./doc/about.md) document to learn the \r\nterminology of DefectDojo, and the\r\n[getting started guide](./doc/getting_started.md) for setting up a new\r\ninstallation.
